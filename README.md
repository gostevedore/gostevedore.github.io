This repository provides a github action named `Publish` which manages the deployment.
When a new site's release is ready to be deployed on your development environment you must follow the steps below to perform the deployment:

1) Create a pull request to `main` branch
2) Merge the pull request, an then the `Publish` action is triggered.
3) Once the `Publish` action is completed properly, the site is already available on https://gostevedore.github.com
> The `Publish` action pushes the code generated by `Hugo` to `gh-pages` repository's branch.
